<!-- HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p> -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another  paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>
            This paragraph
            contains a lot of lines
            in the source code,
            but the browser
            ignores it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This paragraph
                contains         a lot of spaces
                in the source         code,
                but the        browser
                ignores it.
                </p>
    </body>
</html>
<!-- HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
Example -->
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
<!-- HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: -->

<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
<hr>
<!-- The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves 
    both spaces and line breaks: -->
<pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
  </pre>
